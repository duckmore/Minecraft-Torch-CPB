# Minecraft-Torch-CPB
Minecraft Bluetooth Torch using Adafruit circuit playground bluetooth and Neo-pixel ring


This code is based upon the youtube series and work by Prof. John Gallaugher
His videos at https://YouTube.com/profgallaugher Follow on Twitter: @gallaugher

This work uses the following components:
-Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluetooth
-Adafruit NeoPixel Ring x12
-Micro-USB D to USB-C cable to work with the CPB.

The torch is 3d printed using https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2002669
We printed ours in PLA, then spray primed and finished using acrlylic paints. The torch top was printed in transparent PLA using minimum infil. 
On a creality3D Ender 3 Pro, using CURA the base print had a dimensons of 50mm x 50mm x object height, in order to fit the CFB comfortably with a lithium battery we uniformly scaled up the projects x, y dimensions from 50mm up to 60mm x 60 x object height. 
Ours was printed using the "Base upright" "Shaft" and "Head" stl files sliced to the ideal settings for our particular fillament and appetite for speed & quality. 
Depending on your slicer you may need to fix the grid failures in the base STL outside of your slicer.

Make sure your CircuitPlayground Bluefruit (CPB) has the latest version of CircuitPython.
The "lib" folder on your CPB should have the following folders or files:

adafruit_ble
adafruit_bluefruit_connect
adafruit_bus_device
adafruit_circuitplayground
adafruit_led_animation
neopixel.mpy
simpleio.mpy

The latest CircuitPython .uf2 file and the latest library files can be downloaded from https://circuitpython.org
